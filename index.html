        I wake up groggy and disoriented. It takes me a few moments to remember where I am and what day it is. I am in my bedroom, lying in my bed, and it is Monday morning. I reluctantly get out of bed and begin my day. I am not looking forward to today. I have a lot of work to do and I am not feeling very motivated. I go through the motions, getting ready for my day and trying to get myself into a better headspace. I head to my kitchen to make breakfast and I am surprised to find that my cat is already there, meowing for food. I give her some food and she rubs against my leg, purring. I start to feel a little better. I eat breakfast and then head to my desk to start working.

    In many schools today, the phrase "computer-aided instruction" means making the computer teach the child. One might say the computer is being used to program the child.
